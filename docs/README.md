# Developing the documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). 
To run a local server with the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Install the requirements

    ```bash
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the local server

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
